echo "üîç Understanding 'sys/config.h' Error"
echo "======================================"
echo ""

echo "‚ùå The Error:"
echo "  'sys/config.h' file not found"
echo ""

echo "üìö Why This Happens:"
echo "===================="
echo ""
echo "‚Ä¢ ESP8266 uses a minimal embedded toolchain"
echo "‚Ä¢ It doesn't have full POSIX system headers like desktop systems"
echo "‚Ä¢ 'sys/config.h' is a system header that exists on desktop Linux/macOS"
echo "‚Ä¢ ESP8266 toolchain doesn't include this file"
echo "‚Ä¢ clangd expects it to exist (desktop compiler assumption)"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Why It's Safe to Suppress:"
echo "=============================="
echo ""
echo "‚Ä¢ ESP8266 has its own configuration system"
echo "‚Ä¢ Arduino framework provides necessary definitions"
echo "‚Ä¢ Your code compiles perfectly with PlatformIO"
echo "‚Ä¢ This is a false positive from clangd"
echo ""

echo "üîß What We Did:"
echo "==============="
echo ""
echo "‚Ä¢ Added 'err_pp_file_not_found' to suppression list"
echo "‚Ä¢ This suppresses 'file not found' errors for system headers"
echo "‚Ä¢ Your code functionality is unaffected"
echo "‚Ä¢ Go-to-definition still works perfectly"
echo ""

echo "üí° Key Point:"
echo "============"
echo ""
echo "ESP8266 is an embedded system with a minimal toolchain."
echo "It doesn't need (and doesn't have) full desktop system headers."
echo "This error is clangd trying to apply desktop standards to embedded code."
